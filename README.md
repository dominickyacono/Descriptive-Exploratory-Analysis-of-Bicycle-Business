# Descriptive and Exploratory Analysis of Bicycle Business
Beginner project to analyze simple patterns and trends within a fictional bicycle business. Purpose of project is to showcase proficiency in using both SQL and Python.

The link included in this repository directs to Datacamp.com, where this project was coded. 
Using Datacamp.com's notebook feature (similar to jupyter notebooks), I utilized SQL querying alongside coding with Python's data science packages such as pandas, matplotlib, and scipy to calculate simple descriptive analytics and plot visuals.

Also included in this repository is a entity relationship diagram that highlights the relationships between tables in the bicycle business' database. Primary keys are indicated with key icons.
