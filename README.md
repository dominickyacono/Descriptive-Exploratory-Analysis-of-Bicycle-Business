Using Datacamp.com's notebook feature (similar to jupyter notebooks), I utilized SQL querying alongside coding with Python's data science packages such as pandas, matplotlib, and scipy to calculate simple descriptive analytics and plot visuals.

Included in this repository is a entity relationship diagram that highlights the relationships between tables in the bicycle business' database. Primary keys are indicated with key icons.
